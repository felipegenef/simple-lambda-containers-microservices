# Multi Language Serverless Micro-services

Template with 3 micro-services made in different languages deployed under the same API Gateway. You can create as many as the stack allows with any language you like.
All of them use [AWS LAMBDA WEB ADAPTERS](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-web-adapter) so they can run normal web apps on port 8080 and still respond to lambda calls.
There are also some examples of how to make an isolated function apart from your micro-service, so you can apply the Strangler Pattern and slowly decouple your lambda functions.

## How to use it?

Instructions can be found [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).
