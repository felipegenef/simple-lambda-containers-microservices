  "description": "Template with 3 micro-services made in different languages deployed under the same API Gateway. You can create as many as the stack allows with any language you like. All of them use [AWS LAMBDA WEB ADAPTERS](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-web-adapter) so they can run normal web apps on port 8080 and still respond to lambda calls. There are also some examples of how to add an isolated function appart from you micro-service, so you can scale it individualy. There is also an example of how to scale one endpoint with SQS directly from API Gateway. ## How to use it? #### Install AWS CLI Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html). #### deploy your app #### deploy your app ```bash sls deploy ``` #### Get the console url Get the url displayed in your console and replace it in your calls (baseURL) ##### For accessing the Golang Micro-service ```bash curl baseURL/go/api ``` ##### For accessing the Node.js Micro-service ```bash curl baseURL/js/api ``` ##### For accessing the Python Micro-service ```bash curl baseURL/py/api ```",
